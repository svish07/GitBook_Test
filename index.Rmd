# Prerequisites

A sample book created to help XV create a public UI for the bookdown project for ESV

```{r eval=FALSE, include = FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Several packages have to be installed and therefore we look at the mechanisms required. 

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
